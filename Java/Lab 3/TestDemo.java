 * WELCOME TO LAB 3!
 * The essence of this lab is to work with constructors and to show overloaded constructor calls.

 * It helps to consolidate understanding of the chaining rules learned in the theory class
 * This program also displays a good example of writing comments in your code using the Javadoc style.
